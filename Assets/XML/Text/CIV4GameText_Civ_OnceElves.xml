		<English>Sluagh are mortal souls. They will attempt to pass to Arawn's realm if they aren't claimed by any of the gods or trapped by a necromancer. Occasionally a strong sense of duty will cause a Slaugh to remain after its death; this is the only time a person can be resurrected by normal means (most resurrection spells cannot reclaim souls from the afterworld, hell or the god's vaults). The Sluagh's will to regain life will determine how long they remain in creation and are available to be resurrected. The Elohim use a trick to bypass this restriction and assign a soul catcher to their royalty. The soul catcher is a mage specializing in spirit magic who can trap the soul after death and hold it until a resurrection is available. Some Necromancers are known to bind Sluagh to their services.</English>
